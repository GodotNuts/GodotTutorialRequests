# Godot Tutorial and Game Template Requests
This repository is a place where anyone can request a tutorial or game template for the Godot Game Engine.


# Requesting a tutorial
In order to request a tutorial, please file an issue on this repository. Include as much info as you can, so I can ensure you get what you're looking for!

# Requesting a game template
When you request a game template in the issues, like with the tutorials, include as much information as you can that's allowed to be public. Include examples of art you want it to look like (but not actual art from your game!), specific control schemes, music/sfx demos, everything you can imagine; but do not include anything that is . Anything is helpful, even a story or game design document! The template will attempt to follow what you have, if not specifically, at least to ensure that the template game has most of the capabilities you need.


# Rates
The price for a tutorial is generally pretty low depending on complexity, and the price for a template is generally higher. However, I have created a few GitHub template repositories publicly available already; this won't be as customized as you need, nor will I be working on them significantly more than the first several revisions, but most of them should get you to a point that you can learn how to code the rest. Consider using one of those before requesting a custom template. 

Tutorials: First request per unique person is free. Further tutorials are $10 per simple tutorial, $50 per complex one (note that's not per hour, but per tutorial). The ultimate price will be quoted to you somewhere in between those values, most likely. Tutorials will be public on my YouTube channel, found here: https://youtube.com/c/KyleSzklenski. The tutorial will not be started to be created until payment is made. Please note that tutorials can be about any topic in Godot, and I'm willing to entertain them in Aseprite, though I'm not an expert. What I am is able to figure out what the best approach is.

Game templates: Custom game templates generally cost by the hour. Time will be recorded strictly. As I have a day job, generally the number of hours per day will be low until the weekends, but regardless, the rate for full game templates, customized to your level of need (given appropriate requirements), including revisions if I get something wrong as well as demos as I create it to ensure it's what you want, starts at $30 per hour and goes up, depending on complexity; mistakes or bugs are fixed for free within reasonability. You will be quoted a minimum hour requirement with a minimum hourly rate before any work begins, and will sign a contract, as the game template will be yours to own, and no one else will have exactly that. Art and music and things of that nature will help me to understand your requirements better, such as sprite sizes, animation styles and counts, the need for multiple audio buses and so on. 

The templates may be based on the free templates, but highly customized to fit your needs. This is to save you time and money, but also me effort.
